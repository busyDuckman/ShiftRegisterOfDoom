** Notes: **
  - This is my first KiCad project, I am trasitioning from eagleCad so right now I am probably doing things I will cringe at later.
  - I am building this for a trainset, so some design considerations reflect that.
  
** The Breakout board:  **  
  Created using [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/)  
  Source in \TPIC6B595_power_sift_reg_breakout  
  
** The Arduino Code:  **  
  Once the electrical work is done.
